# Documentation Policies

## Documentation

The project documentation will reside on the `wiki` page or/and in the` doc` folder of the project repository.

When a new feature is added or a significant change is made. Firstly, a design proposal must be created and only once it is accepted and implemented will be added as part of the project documentation.

## Design Proposals

The design proposal is to make communication easier with team members and be clear about the idea and documentation. 

A design proposal is necessary only when a new feature is added or a significant change is made. Therefore it is not necessary to do it for simple changes or bug fixes.

To create a design proposal, you must create an `github issue` in the repository of the project and use the template below:

```
### Title
A descriptive title

### Overview
High-level description

### Use Cases
Use cases for new feature

### Design
Implementation details

### Test Approach
List planned test approach and tests (e.g., unit, integration).

### Open points
Open questions
```
